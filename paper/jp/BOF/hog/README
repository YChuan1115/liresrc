Installation
============

Unzip hopdfg.zip in the folder you like.
In a default setting, for SVM classification, this package requires SMO package which can be downloaded from
http://staff.aist.go.jp/takumi.kobayashi/code/SMO.zip
So, unzip SMO.zip and add the path into MATLAB cache. 
In addition, this also requires the vlfeat toolbox (http://www.vlfeat.org/) for extracting SIFT local descriptors.

Data
====

You can apply these codes to any kinds of image datasets in which all image files 
are located in a directory; e.g., 0000.jpg, 0001.jpg.

Information for class labels as well as cross-validation sets be descrived in 'cv_data_*.mat' which includes
the following variables;
 classes      - Class names ([1 x nclass], cell array)
 trainflist   - File names excluding extension ('.jpg') for training, such as {'0000','0002',...} ([1 x ntrain], cell array)
 trainID      - Class indicators by {-1,+1} for training ([ntrain x nclass], array)
 vwtrainflist - File names for training visual words
 vwtrainID    - Class indicators for training visual words
 testflist    - File names for test
 testID       - Class indicators for test

The class indicators are formed by
  -1 -1 -1 +1 -1 -1 -1
  +1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
           :
where the i-th sample belonging to the j-th class is indicated by the i-th row which has +1 only at the j-th column and 0 on others.

The codes in "util" generates those 'cv_data_*.mat' files.


Usage
=====

First, you rearrange the image files in dataset as mentioned above into the directory (PATH_TO_IMAGES)
and prepare the file of 'cv_data_*.mat' in the root directory (ROOTPATH).
Then, by indicating the path to vlfeat that you have already installed, just type
 >> run_all

After finishing all procedure, you can find the following directories in ROOTPATH
 <ROOTPATH>/phow_desc/    : SIFT local descriptors
           /visualwords/  : visual words
		   /grad_dir/     : Basis direction for coding orientations of p.d.f gradients
		   /result/       : Classification results
