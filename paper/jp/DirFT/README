Installation
============

Unzip dirft.zip in the folder you like.


Usage
=====

After downloading an image dataset, you can run the script code in './script'.
For example, './script/run_voc_dirfk_bow.m' is the code for Dirichlet Fisher kernel on bag-of-word features (see Sec.2 & 4.2),
and './script/run_*_dirgmmfk.m' are for Dirichlet-derived GMM Fisher kernel (see Sec.3 & 4.3).
Please note that you have to specify the following paths in those script codes ('run_*.m') beforehand;
 ROOTPATH - The working directory where the result files will be stored
 PATH_TO_DATASET - The directory containing the dataset

For details, please refer to the respective files, './script/run_*.m' and './util/cvdata_*.m'.

The files './util/cvdata_*.m' construct cross-validation sets in the dataset.

NOTE1: You can apply the method to a new dataset by correspondingly writing cvdata_<newdataset>.m and run_<newdataset>.m.
NOTE2: You can use your own classifier by simply modifying the file './classify/linearsvm_smo.m'.


Cross-validation set
====================

Cross-validation set is required to train and test the method.
The files './util/cvdata_*.m' are used to produce the following variables:
 classes      - Class names ([1 x nclass], cell array)
 trainflist   - File names for training ([1 x ntrain], cell array)
 trainID      - Class category labels (1,2,...) for training ([ntrain x 1], array)
 vwtrainflist - File names for training visual words
 vwtrainID    - Class category labels for training visual words
 testflist    - File names for test
 testID       - Class category labels for test
which are stored in 'ROOTPATH/cv_data_test.mat', and
 dirpath - Path to the directory containing image files
 flists  - Image file names ([1 x nfile], cell array)
which are stored in 'ROOTPATH/imagefiles.mat'.
